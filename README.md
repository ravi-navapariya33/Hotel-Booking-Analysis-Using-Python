# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Using-Python
# Project Overview

This repository contains a Hotel Booking Analysis project that leverages Python to explore and analyze hotel booking data. The goal of this project is to gain insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, seasonal trends, room occupancy, and pricing strategies using real-world hotel booking datasets.

In this analysis, we will utilize Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, to derive actionable insights that could benefit hotel management in optimizing operations, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

# Technologies Used

Python – Programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization and plotting.
Scikit-learn – For machine learning models (optional for predictive analysis).
Jupyter Notebook – For interactive development and analysis.
Numpy – For numerical calculations.
SQL – For querying data (if applicable).
# Project Features

The project covers the following aspects of hotel booking analysis:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Exploring missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Handling categorical and numerical data preprocessing.

Booking Trends:
Analyzing booking trends over time (seasonality, peaks in booking patterns).
Identifying customer preferences by nationality, customer type, and room type.

Cancellation Analysis:
Investigating why bookings are canceled and the effect of cancellations on revenue.
Comparing the booking status between the two types of hotels (e.g., resort vs. city hotel).

Revenue and Pricing Analysis:
Exploring the relationship between booking length, room type, and pricing.
Identifying pricing trends based on the time of year, room type, and occupancy rates.

Predictive Modeling (Optional):
Developing a machine learning model to predict cancellations or future booking behavior.
Implementing regression analysis to predict room pricing based on various features.

Visualizations:
Creating visual representations of key metrics such as booking status, seasonal trends, and pricing patterns.
